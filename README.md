## Making my own theme from scratch. <br>

- [x] CSS custom styling (imported using script)
- [x] Nav Menu
- [x] Header
- [x] Footer
- [x] Sidebar
- [x] Posts (uses TheLoop)
- [ ] Comments 
- [ ] Mobile Responsive <br><br>

- [x] Wrote my own plugin (The plugin replaces instances of the word "WordPress" with the word "RICKY".) <br><br>

## This image will have to do until I figure out how to put it live on a wordpress subdomain but before that.. comments.
